using autoglobals
	2 most common ways that php interfaces with the user is by accessiing values from fill-in forms that are submitted to a php script by handling events 
	such as dynamically displaying pages when the user clicks a hyperlinnk. The data needs to process these interactionsis stored in php auto globals.

	Auto globals are associative arrays which are arrays whos elements referred to with an alphanumeric key instead of an index number.
	Environmental variables that programs use to interact with the system. _env the elements in the $_ENV change depending on the operating system and machine confifg.
	$_SERVER[] - contains info about the web server and php scripting engine
	$_ENV	- Contains information about the environtment. Programs use to interact with the system.

Building html web forms
	Interactive controls that allow users to enter data in text input boxes Web forms provice methods for electronically submitting the 
`	form data entered by a user to the program onthe server to process input.
	Web forms are used whenever server requires user input.eg order processing, billing, subscribing to email to newsletter, searching web forms
	web forms aree standard html page. only diff is the web form requires form tag and the markup contains controlls.

adding action attribute
	form opening tag requires an action attribute the value identies the program on the server that will process the form data when submitted. php often used to process form data.

adding method attribute
	opening form tag must also contain a method attribute which defines how the form data is submitted to the server.
	method will either be post or get.
	post form data is embedded in the request message. 
	get the form data is appended to the url specified in the forms action attribute
	when you click submit each field on the form is sent to the server as a key/value pair. 
	when post is used the name portion of the name/value pair becomes the key and the index of the element in the post array and the value is assigned as the value of the array element.
	when get is used the same happens except the name portion of the name/value pair gecomes the key of an element in the get array.
	the get method to submit form data to the processing script the form data is appended to the url specified by the action attribute. name/value pair is appended to the end of the url called url tokens.
	the form is separated by a ? mark and each individual element is separated by a & and the element name is separated from the value by an equal sign =
	spaces in the name and value field are encoded as a + and all other chars except letters numbers - _ and . are encoded using a % sign followed by the 2 digit hex representaion of the chars ascii value
